Based on the provided rubric, I will grade the essay on each criterion:

Claim & Focus:
Grade: 3 - Proficient
Reasoning: The thesis is relatively clear and takes a stance on the topic. The focus is generally maintained throughout the essay, but there are instances where it could be stronger and more specific.

Evidence & Support:
Grade: 2 - Basic
Reasoning: While evidence is provided to support the thesis, there are issues with the quality and relevance of the evidence. Some parts lack credible sources and the explanation of evidence is often unclear.

Organization:
Grade: 2 - Basic
Reasoning: The essay has an organizational structure but it lacks clarity and smooth transitions between paragraphs. The flow of ideas is disrupted in some places.

Language & Style:
Grade: 2 - Basic
Reasoning: The writing is somewhat clear but lacks a strong command of language and style. There are inconsistencies in language use and sentence structures.

Conventions:
Grade: 2 - Basic
Reasoning: There are noticeable errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling throughout the essay. These errors can impact the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay.

Conclusion:
Grade: 2 - Basic
Reasoning: While the conclusion attempts to summarize key points and reinforce the thesis, it could be strengthened with a more impactful closure to the essay.

Overall, the essay shows potential but needs improvement in clarity, evidence quality, organization, language use, and grammar.
