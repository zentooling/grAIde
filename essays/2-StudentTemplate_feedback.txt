Claim & Focus: 2 - Basic
The thesis statement is somewhat clear in stating that video games are detrimental, but it could be more specific in terms of outlining the three reasons that will be discussed in the essay. The focus on the detriments of video games is generally maintained throughout the essay, but there are areas where the connection to the thesis could be stronger.

Evidence & Support: 2 - Basic
While the essay attempts to provide evidence to support the thesis statement, the evidence presented is not always strong or relevant. Some of the examples lack depth and are not effectively integrated into the argument. More concrete and specific evidence could strengthen the essay's argumentation.

Organization: 2 - Basic

Language & Style: 2 - Basic
The language used in the essay is basic and lacks sophistication. There is a need for more variety in sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance the overall quality of the writing. Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, impacting the clarity of the argument.

Conventions: 2 - Basic
There are noticeable errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling throughout the essay. These errors can be distracting and hinder the readability of the content. Proofreading for these mistakes is essential to improve the overall presentation.

Conclusion: 1 - Limited
The conclusion of the essay is weak and does not effectively summarize the key points discussed in the body paragraphs. It lacks a strong connection to the thesis statement and fails to provide a satisfying closure to the essay.

Plagiarism Check:
The essay contains instances of potential plagiarism. Multiple sections include direct quotes or paraphrased content without proper citation. Here are some examples of potential plagiarism:
- The opening sentence: "Imagine a digital world that involves the relentless pursuit of destruction, where the glow of screens becomes a detrimental substitute for talking with people or interacting with people."
- The sentence: "As stated in the article 60% of middle school boys and 40% of middle school girls who played at least one."
- The sentence: "forehead kisses, and we often associated with parental love or love-based relationships."

To avoid plagiarism, it is crucial to properly cite all sources and use quotation marks when directly quoting text from another author.

Overall, this essay would benefit from a clearer thesis statement, stronger evidence with proper integration, improved organization, enhanced language use, and better adherence to conventions. Additionally, plagiarism should be avoided by providing proper citations for borrowed content.
